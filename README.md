# Logic Gate Neurons: Learning in Action -------------------------------------------------------------
In this project, I used Python to create a simple artificial neural network, focusing on perceptrons, to simulate basic logic gates such as AND, OR, and XOR. The perceptron is the simplest type of neural network, with a single layer of neurons that perform binary classification based on a linear decision boundary.

The project aimed to demonstrate how perceptrons can be trained to mimic the behavior of these gates by adjusting their weights and bias through a supervised learning algorithm. For each gate, I defined input and expected output pairs, then trained the perceptron to learn the correct mapping. The perceptron successfully learned the AND, OR gates, showcasing its ability to model linearly separable problems.

However, a key part of the project was exploring the limitations of the perceptron. While it can easily simulate simple logic gates, it fails to model the XOR gate due to the non-linearly separable nature of its output. This led to a discussion on the need for multi-layer networks (such as multi-layer perceptrons or deep neural networks) to handle more complex decision boundaries.

# Adaptive Rock Paper Scissors Game against AI using Deep Q-Learning ---------------------------------
This project focuses on building an intelligent agent capable of playing and adapting to the classic game of Rock Paper Scissors in real-time using Deep Q-Learning, a reinforcement learning technique. The goal was to create an AI that could not only play against a human opponent but also learn and adjust its strategy based on the player's behavior over time.

In the game, the AI initially plays randomly, as it has no prior knowledge of the player's patterns. However, as the game progresses, the AI gathers data from previous rounds, learning the tendencies and strategies of the opponent. Using Deep Q-Learning, the AI updates its Q-values (a table that helps the agent decide which action to take) by rewarding successful predictions and penalizing wrong moves. Over time, the AI improves its decision-making by identifying patterns in the player's choices and adapting its strategy accordingly.

The neural network used in the Deep Q-Learning model helps generalize from previous game experiences, making the AI more efficient in selecting moves that counter the player's behavior. The result is an adaptive and competitive opponent that grows more challenging the longer the game is played.

This project demonstrates the potential of reinforcement learning techniques in real-time decision-making environments. It highlights how AI can adapt to human behavior dynamically, offering a fun and interactive way to explore advanced AI concepts.

# AI to predict feelings from text -------------------------------------------------------------------
In this project, I developed an AI model to detect six core emotions—Sadness, Joy, Love, Anger, Fear, and Surprise—from textual data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal was to classify a given piece of text into one of these emotional categories by training specialized models for each emotion using a One-vs-Rest (OVR) multi-class classification approach.

The core of the project involved building a separate AI classifier for each emotion. Using Hugging Face’s emotional datasets, I fine-tuned each AI to specialize in recognizing a particular emotion. The OVR strategy allows each model to distinguish its respective emotion from all other possibilities, making the system highly accurate in determining the most likely emotional response for a given text.

By leveraging state-of-the-art NLP techniques and transfer learning, the AI processed text input, analyzed it for linguistic cues, and predicted which of the six emotions was most strongly conveyed. This method enabled more precise emotion detection, as each model was optimized to focus on subtle patterns associated with its specific emotion.

The project demonstrates the effectiveness of using multi-class classification with specialized models for complex tasks like emotion detection, offering potential applications in sentiment analysis, mental health monitoring, and customer feedback analysis.
